# Python program to find whether string is palindrome or not.

Given a string, write a python function to check if it is palindrome or not. 

In this file I have stated 5 different python methods to implement palindrome program. 

A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as string. 
For example, “radar” is a palindrome, but “radix” is not a palindrome.

### Example:
          1. Input: malayalam
             Output: Yes
             
          2. Input: Python
             Output: NO
